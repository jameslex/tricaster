# TriCaster

## Automation and Integration Guide
Created by NewTek and provides instructions on what data can be pulled from TriCaster using http commands.

## tricaster_commands.xml

This file is taken locally from a TriCaster and contains thousands of commands to control a TriCaster externally.

You will see groups with a "prefix" and a "suffix." Pair up a prefix with a suffix to create a command.

Using the commands, you can use appls like [Companion by Bitfocus](https://bitfocus.io/companion) to control a TriCaster using the [http module](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-generic-http).
